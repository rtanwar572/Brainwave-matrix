# ATM Machine Simulation 🏦  
This project is a simulation of an ATM Machine system, developed as part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**. The application provides essential ATM functionalities such as balance inquiry, PIN management, deposit, and withdrawal, implemented using **Java OOP principles**.

## Features ✨  

- **Balance Enquiry**: View account balance securely.  
- **Change PIN**: Update the account PIN to enhance security.  
- **Deposit Amount**: Add money to the account seamlessly.  
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Withdraw money while validating balance and PIN.  
- **Exit Option**: Close the session gracefully.

## Technologies Used 🛠️  
- **Java**  
- **OOP Concepts**  
- **Collections Framework**  
- **Scanner for Input**  
- **Exception Handling**

## Project Workflow 🚀  

1. **Initialization**  
   - A list of pre-defined bank accounts is created with account holder details, PIN, and balance.  

2. **Card Verification**  
   - Simulates the insertion of a card by matching account numbers.  

3. **Main Menu**  
   - Offers the following options:  
     - Balance enquiry  
     - Change PIN  
     - Deposit amount  
     - Withdraw cash  
     - Exit  

4. **Security and Validation**  
   - PIN verification with limited retry attempts to ensure account safety.  

5. **Transactions**  
   - All transactions update the account balance in real-time, ensuring consistency.

## How to Run the Program 💻  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/rtanwar572/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern  
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the Atm.java file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to simulate ATM operations.

## Code Highlights 🌟  

- **Modular Design**:  
  Each feature is implemented as a separate method for better readability and maintainability.  

- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  Clear instructions and validation messages enhance the user experience.  

- **Error Handling**:  
  Handles edge cases like invalid inputs, insufficient balance, and incorrect PIN retries.  

## Sample Output 💻

``` bash
*********** WELCOME **********  
Enter 1 for Balance Enquiry *****  
Enter 2 for Changing PIN *****  
Enter 3 for Deposit Amount *****  
Enter 4 for Withdrawal *****  
Enter 5 for Exit *****  
```

## Future Enhancements 🔮
- Add a database integration for storing and retrieving account data.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
- Support for multilingual interaction.
